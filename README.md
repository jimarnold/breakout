# Breakout

A simple breakout clone

# Requirements:

To run the game: JDK 8 or higher.

To compile and run from source: Scala 2.11.12

Probably OSX only. Works on my machine.

# Controls:

# How to play:

Bounce the ball off the paddle (the rectangle at the bottom of the screen), destroy bricks by hitting them with the ball.
